I was born in the late 90s, grew up with the internet, i enjoyed the topics for discussion of many domain knowledge.\
I usually have a coffe talk with my friends, one day i admited that my interpretation skills is so bad that i can't make my friends to understand what i am saying and i sound like an idiot.\
I'm not considered myself as a very educated person but definitely not a uneducated person. How they talk so eloquently? I means, i cannot be sure that their knowledge is beyond me but i am sure that i have to improve something.\
So perhaps a blog will be a good start?
