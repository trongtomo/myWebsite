# Public Opinion and Accountability in the U.S.

### From Vietnam war

The **Vietnam War** exemplified the significant impact of **public opinion** on war outcomes. Initially, the U.S. government enjoyed strong public support for the war. However, as the conflict dragged on, casualties mounted, and the public’s sentiment began to shift.

A pivotal moment in this shift was the **Gulf of Tonkin incident**, which was later revealed to have been manipulated. The incident, used as a pretext for escalating U.S. involvement in Vietnam, helped justify military action.

It was later suggested that the Gulf of Tonkin was part of a larger **cover-up**, with some speculating that **Lyndon Johnson** used it to justify military escalation in Vietnam, potentially benefiting from increased military contracts and equipment sales.

- Before the Gulf of Tonkin, the **Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)** was using outdated **M1 Garand** rifles, in contrast to the more advanced **AK-47s**.

This manipulation of events led to further U.S. involvement, but as media coverage began to expose the war's brutality, public support waned.

## The Shift in Public Sentiment

With the growing opposition to the war, **protests** surged across the U.S., demanding troop withdrawals. The government, facing mounting pressure, ultimately had no choice but to **withdraw** in 1973.

Similarly, the **Iraq War (2003)** saw a shift in public opinion. Initially supported by many in the U.S. and the U.K., public trust began to diminish after false claims of **weapons of mass destruction** were exposed, leading to growing skepticism and calls for troop withdrawal.

- **Vietnam**: The shift in public opinion played a direct role in ending the conflict.
- **Iraq**: Similarly, the revelation of false information and growing casualties led to increasing opposition.

### The Case of Iraq

The **Iraq War** in 2003 saw **fabricated intelligence** playing a central role in **shaping public opinion**. **"Yellowcake" documents**, later revealed to be forgeries, were used to build a narrative of imminent threat from Iraq, justifying the U.S. invasion. This manipulation of information highlights how the **narrative control** over war justification can influence public support.

- The **Bush administration** relied heavily on these documents to secure backing for war, which ultimately **undermined U.S. credibility** on the global stage.

# Erosion of Accountability

### The Political Landscape Today

In the modern era, a lack of accountability has **undermined trust** in political institutions. **Hunter Biden’s business dealings**, **immigration policy failures**, and the **Biden administration's handling** of both domestic and international issues are examples of **unaccountable behavior**.

- The **Hunter Biden controversy** fueled by the release of his laptop and a book with numerous pictures and proof, continues to dominate political discussions.
- **Alejandro Mayorkas**, evade accountability despite public outcry, particularly disastrous border situation.
- Two-tier justice system under **Merrick Garland** and other instances of perceived lack of accountability have fueled this sentiment.

The rise of **China** as a global power has also revealed a lack of accountability, especially in the context of the **COVID-19 pandemic**. Despite widespread suspicion regarding the virus's origin and **China's initial response**, international institutions, including the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, failed to hold China accountable, allowing it to maintain its global standing without facing significant repercussions.

- **Example**: **China’s influence** in global organizations like the **WTO** has raised concerns about the ability of international bodies to challenge powerful states effectively.

# The Global Impact of Public Opinion and Accountability

### Historical Parallels: Vietnam, Iraq, and Beyond

Throughout history, conflicts like the **Vietnam War** and the **Iraq War** have been defined by **public opinion**. As media outlets and international organizations shed light on the human cost of war, opposition grew, and public sentiment turned against government policies.

- **Vietnam**: Media exposure of the war’s brutality fueled protests and public backlash.
- **Iraq**: Similarly, media coverage and the failure to find WMDs contributed to the erosion of public support.

### Current Struggles: Hamas, Israel, and the Middle East

Today’s global conflicts, including those related to **Hamas** and the **Israel-Palestine conflict**, continue to be influenced by public opinion. Protests in support of **Hamas** echo the **anti-war movements** of past decades, reflecting growing opposition to what some see as **global power imbalances**.

# Accountability and the Role of Global Institutions

### Power Struggles: China, the U.S., and Accountability

As nations like **China** rise in power, the role of **global institutions** in enforcing **accountability** is more critical than ever. However, China's ability to **evade consequences** for actions like the **Wuhan virus** outbreak and its **trade policies** underscores the weaknesses of the global system in holding powerful nations to account.

- **Example**: Despite global concerns, **China** has largely evaded accountability for its actions, highlighting the challenges faced by international bodies in enforcing global norms.

# The Challenge of Public Opinion in Shaping Global Conflicts

### The Power of Public Perception

The role of **public opinion** in modern geopolitics cannot be understated. Whether it’s the **protests against the Iraq War** or **international backlash against China’s actions**, the narratives surrounding these events are shaped by how **media** and **global audiences** perceive the actions of governments.

- **Example**: **Hamas** protests and the **global response** reflect a shift in public sentiment that is challenging traditional geopolitical alliances and assumptions.

# Conclusion

Public opinion, fueled by fabricated narratives and the manipulation of information, plays an undeniable role in shaping the outcome of conflicts and the legitimacy of governments. The **lack of accountability**—whether in the case of **Iraq**, **Vietnam**, or modern geopolitical struggles like **Hamas**—has created an environment where nations, organizations, and political leaders can evade scrutiny.

To move forward, **global institutions** must recognize the power of **public opinion** and prioritize **accountability** in their policies and actions. The cycle of **history repeating itself** will continue unless leaders address the evolving challenges of transparency, justice, and public trust in a world where **narratives** have become as powerful as the weapons used in conflicts.
